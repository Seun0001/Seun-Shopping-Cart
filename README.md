+ This is an HTML document that defines the structure and content of a shopping cart webpage. The document includes a header with a title and navigation links, and a main section that displays the items in the shopping cart, including their images, descriptions, prices, quantities, and subtotals. It also displays the subtotal, tax, shipping, and grand total of the order, as well as a checkout button that triggers a modal window with a congratulatory message. The document also includes a CSS stylesheet and a JavaScript file to add interactivity to the page.
